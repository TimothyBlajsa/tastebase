This is a repository for the IDMX 297 Capstone class' first project of Spring 2022.

## Installation
First, download or clone the latest version of this repository. Once you have the repository downloaded in a suitable location, run the following commands to check to make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
```
node --version
npm --version
```
Then, run the following command to install the necessary npm packages.
```
npm install
```

## Usage
There are three commands that you should use during project development

- **`npm run dev`** will automatically start up Parcel and host a local development server. This has hot reloading enabled, so don't worry about refreshing!

- **`npm run redev`** will clear out cache before running the `dev` command. This is useful for when Parce's hot reloading feature breaks, or SCSS styles aren't being updated properly.

- **`npm run build`** builds the website in its entirety, minifying the source code to its theoretical limit. This will become useful during later stages of development.
